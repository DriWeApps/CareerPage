This is a corrected minimal skeleton of your Next.js app with the API routes placed under `src/app/api/...` and pages under `src/app/...`.

How to use locally:
1. Install deps:
```bash
npm install
```
2. Initialize Prisma and SQLite DB:
```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```
3. Run dev:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- This project uses SQLite for simplicity (prisma/schema.prisma).
- The zip includes source only; run `npm install` after extraction.
